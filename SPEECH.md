For those of you who know me, you know my name is Vadym,
for those of you who doesn't know me... [make a pause]
Actually, everyone knows me.

I loved working here until Antonio joined. Since then I feel threatened by him.
As now he is the biggest guy around here. [dont laught here, this is a painfull moment for you]

But this is not the reason why I am leaving you.
I am joining serbian mafia as there are more perspectives. [look an Nikola]
