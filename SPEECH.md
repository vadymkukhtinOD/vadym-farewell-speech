[Wait for screams "Speech, speech" provocated by an insider (still to be assign)]
[Stading up dramatically and slowly with sadness in his eyes]

## INTRO
[Projector goes down with beautiful ukrainian landscape]
[Music starts playing and start dancing ukrainian traditional dances 
with choir singing ukrainian songs on a background]

For those of you who know me, you know my name is Vadym,
for those of you who doesn't know me... [make a pause and exhale]
Actually, everyone knows me.

### JOKING PART
I loved working here until Antonio joined. Since then I feel threatened by him.
As now he is the biggest guy around here. [don't laugh here, this is a painfull moment for you]

### SAD PART
Jokes aside, it is an amazing company and the one I truly enjoy to work daily.
No matter the reasons I am leaving, want to thank all teams I work with 
and great people I got in tough during almost 2 years here.

Of course, most thanks goes to [RIP] Mercato team:

And EDEN:

Of course, thanks frontend Team and Friedemann for great atmospehere and huge progress I gained here.

Last but not least, thanks everyone who makes this place so great

[People are standing and applause for at least 5 minutes]
[Curtains fall]
